* find-and-ctags (v0.0.2)
Create and update TAGS by combining [[http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/][Find]] and [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags][Ctags]] for any language on Winows/Linux/OSX.

* Why
- Enough tools provided. You can set up any project in 1 minute
- The TAGS file created is *portable*. You can use it anywhere
- Easy to manage. All your projects settings is in your ".emacs"
- Powerful and versatile. Power of Find/Ctags/Lisp is at your hand
* Install
Place find-and-ctags.el somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp), add below code into ".emacs":

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'find-and-ctags)
#+end_src

* Usage
Here is sample setup for project named "MYPROJ":
#+begin_src elisp
(def my-setup-develop-environment ()
     (interactive)
     (let (proj-dir
           FIND-OPTS
           CTAGS-OPTS)

       ;; for COOL MYPROJ
       ;; you can use fctags-current-full-filename-match-pattern-p instead
       (when (fctags-current-path-match-pattern-p "MYPROJ.*/app")
         (setq proj-dir (if fctags-windows-p "c:/Workspaces/MYPROJ/MACWeb/WebContent/app"
                     "~/projs/MYPROJ/MACWeb/WebContent/app"))
         (setq FIND-OPTS "-not -size +64k  -not -iwholename '*/dist/*'")
         (setq CTAGS-OPTS "--exclude=*.min.js --exclude=*.git*")
         ;; or use setq-local instead
         (setq tags-table-list
              (list (fctags-run-ctags-if-needed proj-dir FIND-OPTS CTAGS-OPTS))))

       ;; for other projects
       ;; insert NEW when statements here
       ))

"tags-table-list" is the global variable defined in Emacs. find-and-ctags will set up it for you.

After the "tags-table-list" is set, you can `M-x find-tag` to do code navigation. "find-tags" is the command bundled with Emacs.
* Advanced Tips (OPTIONAL)
** Filter files feeded into Ctags
"fctags-run-ctags-if-needed" actually only execute the below command line in shell:
#+begin_src bash
find . -type f -not -name 'TAGS' FIND-OPTS | ctags -e CTAGS-OPTS -L -
#+end_src

So you can insert extra command chain into FIND-OPTS.

For example, if you assign FIND-OPTS to " | grep 'test.*'", the actual command to execute will be:
#+begin_src bash
find . -type f -not -name 'TAGS' | grep 'test.*' | ctags -e CTAGS-OPTS -L -
#+end_src
** Detect hostname of current computer
Use API "(fctags-get-hostname)"
** Time interval to update TAGS
It's defined in the global variable "fctags-auto-update-tags-interval". The unit of time is the second. 
** Ctags setup
Google "filetype:ctags site:github.com". Here is [[https://gist.github.com/redguardtoo/b12ddae3b8010a276e9b#file-ctags][mine]].

You may need configure environment variable "HOME" on Windows because ctags looks for "%HOME%/.ctags" by default.
